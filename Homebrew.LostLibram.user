  <thing id="dtyAcydea" name="Acydea" description="Acydea is generally regarded as being the most beautiful of all the gods in Cobrin&apos;Seil. Indeterminate of either race or gender, Acydea appears simply as a humanoid of varying heights whose beauty transcends gender, and is only ever found in natural areas. Acydea is said to dance in the rain of a moonlight night, and by Acydea&apos;s hands, the music of the forests echoes back and forth.\n\nThe church of Acydea is very strong in the wild places of the world, but even stronger in those areas near civilisation. In Kyngdom, the people are too practical to generally consider a god whose portfolio does include artistry, but in Corrindale, the flighty and charismatic wu-kan typically regard Acydea with at least some degree of devotion. The church is surprisingly strong in the lands of Horandi, where the harshness of the natural lands make excessive expansion difficult, and the sunsets are particularly beautiful.\n\nAcydea&apos;s clerics pray for spells at noon of each day, or at midnight. Acydea is a god of centers, of middles, and of balances - he wishes to be esteemed and in his followers&apos; thoughts when the sun or moon is highest in the sky.\n\nAcydea does not have any gods beneath him, or any secondary pantheon over which he holds sway. His dominion of nature is almost unchallenged in the Greater Pantheon, and his beauty is completely unmatched. As a being so purely embodying a philosophy, he does not distribute his power, nor does he feel any need or desire to achieve a pantheon of allies." compset="Deity" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="dtyBeinjar" name="Beinjar" description="Dancing and laughing through history, Beinjar is the eternal observor, the greatest gossip and the monger of rumours. Whether true or not, people love a good story, and Beinjar is happy to satisfy them. Perhaps embellished, perhaps reimagined, and perhaps in some cases outright fabricated, the stories told by Beinjar and his followers are supposedly designed to host a kernel of honesty, some truism about how life works. Lighthearted, lightfingered and lightfooted, Beinjar travels the realms telling and making stories, in song and in verse.\n\nBeinjar&apos;s avatar is actually a hat, with an extravagent feather in it. People who wear the hat find themself overtaken by the deity, and given his quick tongue and ease with people and his hands, it&apos;s not difficult at all for Beinjar to tie himself to a particular individual. The colour of the feather varies as per Beinjar&apos;s mood - black if he feels more wicked, white if he feels more lighthearted. Stories are told of individuals whose own personality influences the colour of the feather, though this being related to Beinjar, perhaps they are just stories.\n\nBeinjar&apos;s followers are much in the same mould as he is - wanderers and jesters who can&apos;t find satisfaction being fixed in place. At their finest, they&apos;re rogues and wanderers who move from place to place, helping people; at their worst, they&apos;re serial con-artists and tricksters, swindling people out of charms and coin and moving on, one step ahead of the consequences.\nHistory/Relationships\n\nBeinjar&apos;s status as a hat is something of a curse, inflicted upon him by Gwynm. During the first days after the Death of Kurtulmak, the deities returned to the world to meet with their followers, Beinjar - who had a long and speckled history as a laughing, wandering rogue in competition with the Nimble One - found himself interested in wooing a lady in a library he thought attractive. Suffice to say, this did not work out for him well.\n\nBeinjar&apos;s friends in the pantheon are those who can keep up with or appreciate him. Inseus is a bit too murderous, but Beinjar appreciates a good villain, and the Nimble One&apos;s penchant for focusing on her own race to the exclusion of others is something he feels is a bit of a loss. He still gets along fine with the more relaxed members of the pantheon, such as Yojandur and Uilian.\nDogma\n\nWhatever the story, remember - people are people, and no story, truth or lie, works where people don&apos;t act like people. Keep moving, always keep moving. You don&apos;t own anything you can&apos;t carry at a dead run, you don&apos;t know anyone who can&apos;t keep up.

Terrorism, fear, heaping bodies, charnel foulness, and the ever-present stench of death, all are hallmarks of a deed well done to a cleric of Belladan. She is a harsh and cruel mistress, given to almost insane fury in battle, despite her lawful alignment, and is not above exploiting more chaotic forces.\n\nBelladan appears as a voluptuous, impractically clad woman with a pair of longswords and a longbow. She is always remarkably beautiful, after a harsh, angular fashion, and her hands are always stained slightly with blood. Belladan appears to be almost naked on a battlefield, but she also knows the value of intimidation, and always wears invisible armour. Her faith is on the rise amongst the expansionists in Nbyana, who perceive her as a great goddess of war and power. Particularly the Leopardmen of the Nbyana rainforests revere her.\n\nBelladan&apos;s clerics pray for spells immediately after waking - before eating or performing any other deeds.

  <thing id="dtyBriarho" name="Briarhorn" description="Of all the greater gods, Briarhorn is the one who has most resisted the position of their own authority. Even Schwarzstrom, with her capricious nature, assumed the mantle of responsibility by choice when she realised that others would threaten the things she wished to protect. Briarhorn appears to have no greater desire than to be left alone. Of course, this solitary nature - much like Schwarzstrom&apos;s own aggressive candor - has an appeal to certain people, even those who do not know of suh a god directly. Thus Briarhorn has become the icon for the solitary, the contemplative, the survivalistic and the fatalistic.\n\nBriarhorn&apos;s avatar is rare in its incarnation. Due to the Titan&apos;s fundamentally solitary nature, it can be very difficult to glean anything but the most fleeting of glances; many accounts of Briarhorn&apos;s avatar are the result of second or third hand relays, and may be mixed in with a large quantity of myth, hearsay, or simple mistakes. Typically Briarhorn is noted as a large, mountain-shaped humanoid, who has a pair of deer&apos;s antlers, long, wild hair, tusks like a musk deer and a tail like an alligator. It is commonly said to be covered in greenery, as if it is growing there, and is most often described as being as much animal as human. Briarhorn&apos;s gender - if the god has one - is a question unto itself, but in the absence of evidence most mortals presume whatever they prefer.\n\nFollowers of Briarhorn come from all walks of life. Contrary to popular wisdom, the Survivor does not exclusively patron those who live out in the edges of civilization; Briarhorn&apos;s defining aspect is solitude, not barbarism. The Titan has patrons amongst all walks of life, typically those who are driven to the point of obsession - people who have realised they have a skill that is so important to them it becomes all-consuming. These are the people to whom the pursuit of their individual distinction is much more important than ordinary needs or desires, whether their own or those of others. Unknowingly or otherwise, more than a few engineers and artists patron Briarhorn, alone in the midst of a city and content with their craft and their craft alone.\nHistory/Relationships\n\nUnsurprisingly, Briarhorn has no real relationships amongst the pantheon. The Survivor has occasionally appeared in times of great need - such as in the opposition of Edih - but it was to pursue a personal goal, to be tested against a most powerful hunter. Most of the greater gods believe that Briarhorn worked at times with Schwarzstrom, though she claims she has nothing to do with her fellow individualist, respecting Briarhorn&apos;s desire to be left alone.\nDogma\n\nLearn to be alone. You do not need others to define you; you are not your goals, you are not your pursuits. There is no such thing as completion, merely varying stages of abandonment, and there is no such thing as true connection. You are born alone into this world and you will die alone, and only you will ever be able to judge your worth. Concern yourself not with transient things like the laws of man or the directives of kingdoms, instead taking to that which you feel makes you you." compset="Deity">

  <thing id="dtyEl" name="El" description="El isn&apos;t really considered to be a god. To many gods, he&apos;s simply an incredibly ancient and enormously powerful Dragon who has been upstart enough to sit in on occasional meetings of the Greater Pantheon. Given to incredible stealth, El is only known to be a god by a handful of people in the entire world - and that is a situation he intends to maintain. Given his own origins - being a god that was created in the very primordial facets of time itself - he sees himself as possibly more powerful and in turn, more dangerous, than any force in Cobrin&apos;Seil but for Erhymn himself.\n\nEl appears as a colossal force dragon, transparent but for his white eyes and the faint shadows of his enormous body. He takes on, from this form, various humanoid forms to better manoeuvre through the world, and a favourite is a white-haired adolescent. El, despite being a god, is surprisingly self-conscious, and seems to occasionally need reassurance. This is typically because while El is a being of immense power, he also holds immense responsibility. Unlike other gods of Cobrin&apos;Seil, whose power hinges on their worshippers, he owns to slightly elevated status with his power being derived from time itself, and as such, he wonders often if he is indeed, worthy of this power.\n\nThe church of El is nonexistent. El does not need worshippers to increase in power - he is the representation of time itself, and his unseeable, unknowable and ineffable power stems from the fact that he is as close to a Primal Force as can be in Cobrin&apos;Seilwithout being one of them. El does not see this as a reason to feel too superior, however. He maintains a very small, select clergy, and selects only those who he believes agree with him in issues of importance to him - freedom, life, love, liberty, and the right of all to truth, no matter how harsh. If El approaches an individual who rejects his offer, he simply undoes the event in history - it becomes nothing more than a tangent in time that El alone can see and therefore remember.\n\nEl&apos;s church, being as small as it is, has little to no forms of ritual, but El does exhort his followers to research and study the ritual of other faiths.\n\nEl does not expect his followers to wield his favoured weapons, and he often suggests to each of them a weapon that best befits their stature and abilities. This does not confer on the follower any particular proficiency or similar, but it does remove what El feels to be an unnecessary straitjacket." compset="Deity">

  <thing id="dtyErallab" name="Erallabein Delfae" description="The elves of Cobrin&apos;Seil run a gamut of alignments, from the Good-aligned Sun elf nation to the almost Lawful Evil High elf enclaves. However, regardless of god or personal position, the elves of Cobrin&apos;Seil all revere Erallabein, the god of all the elven gods.\n\nErallabein appears as a one-eyed elf of much greater height than normal, with incredibly pale skin and a trio of longswords slung over one shoulder and a longbow over the other. He has a ruggedly handsome look rather than the typically fey appearance of many elves, though this is often attributed to the fact that, as a god, he is closer in form to a LeShay, the primal elven race, than what is commonly understood to be an elf.\n\nErallabein&apos;s clerics pray for spells before they go to sleep at night, or, in the case of pure elves, trance. Erallabein wishes to watch over his people as they rest, and he wishes to aid them swiftly if their sleep is disturbed.\n\nErallabein imposes on every elven creature that doesn&apos;t flagrantly reject him a minor habit, a ritual, or some might say, a quirk. This is usually a very minor aspect of a character&apos;s life - they are forbidden from eating fish, drinking liquors of non-elven make, or are not permitted to wear blue with green - but they are, to Erallabein, a reminder of his ownership of the elven race, and in the way of the elves, a thanks for the freedom he granted them from the tyranny of the Forerunners." compset="Deity">

  <thing id="dtyGwynm" name="Gwynm" description="Gwynm, unlike many of the gods in the pantheon, is almost completely secular. She makes no particular commands of her followers, trusting them to work things out for themself. She does not issue a list of commandments, but instead proposes what is known as The Method - a system for determining the truth of something, with evidence. It is therefore no great surprise that her followers tend to be relaxed, rarely hold holy wars (preferring a sort of holy debate), and generally are good-natured, positive people. Not nearly as competitive or combative as other deities, Gwynm goes for long stretches of time doing nothing but studying. She&apos;s a reactive goddess, and so are her followers - more likely to defend a town than conquer a new land.\n\nGwynm&apos;s avatar tends to be a suited, bookish woman, with her hair done up tidily in a bun, with glasses and more often than not, a book in her hand. She does not make any real concessions to fashion or beauty, and simply is. In times of protracted study, she will often be slightly dishevilled, and can generally be found in areas focused heavily on learning. Due to the understated nature of Gwynm&apos;s avatar, she is often found in mortal libraries, researching in the same way as her followers.\n\nGwynm&apos;s followers are typically scholars and educators. The church of Gwynm has been recently cemented in the educational facilities of Kyngdom, roaming priests that arrive at towns and teach people things - and how to teach other things - before moving on. Every act of study for its own sake, every researcher buried in his work and every explorer who muses, &quot;that&apos;s funny&quot;, is in some small way contributing to Gwynm&apos;s spheres.\nHistory/Relationships\n\nDuring the Second Age, worship of Gwynm became stifled, as priests and scholars alike lauded The Method as divinely inspired. When the Third Age began and the gods returned to the world, she made it eminently clear - that Gwynm was merely an avatar for human understanding, and that the Method was something that humanity understood before she came to be. This led to a very brief, but very polite holy debate, during which the church of Gwynm settled itself down and got back to reading.\n\nGwynm has a bit of an odd relationship with Yojandur, finding his trusting nature foolish and exasperating. Because Yojandur is always willing to give another a chance at redemption, there have been many times when the plans of the good god have struck upon the rocks, halted due to his unwillingness to consider the chances that he&apos;s being deceived.\nDogma\n\nTrust, but verify. Within each individual is the potential to understand the universe, and each individual is part of the universe. Therefore, these vast wonders that we see, this manifold place of colour and sound, is but an aspect of ourselves, and we are that same thing, trying to understand ourselves.

  <thing id="dtyInseus" name="Inseus" description="Stories are told of a madman who travels the land, kidnapping men on their wedding nights and feeding them their own innards. Or of a ghost that recounts her tale of woe, as all her family were locked in their rooms, the house set alight, and she driven to suicide by the revelations that ensued. Behind every macabre campfire story, you can usually find the hand of Inseus, the eternally reincarnate. Somewhere in history, Inseus started his life as a mortal man, reincarnated after his death by some other deity&apos;s whimsy. With the death of Edih, it&apos;s believed he inherited some of that bleak god&apos;s power, and his new lives become a kind of monument to deific taint.\n\nTo wit, he murders because he enjoys it, travelling the land and finding new and interesting ways to be the villain of a tale, before being cut down and dying in some terrible fashion, taking out as many people as he can on the way. If these deaths were at all permanent, it would be grand - but alas, Inseus merely lies subdued for a while, reborn in a new mortal frame after each death. Sometimes there&apos;s a rhyme or a reason, an attempt at showing some kind of object lesson to people, in Inseus&apos; horrible acts. But for the most part, they are just random and self-serving.\n\nThe avatar of Inseus is as capricious and whimsical as his horrific practices, and changes traits like race and gender on an irregular basis. It tends to follow a certain style, however - slightly old-fashioned clothing, typically in black and red, with lace and often ruffles. Inseus usually appears as something of a dandy, diabolically playful and carefree. That&apos;s not to say he doesn&apos;t sometime dispense with the formalities and take the form of a burly man with a pick; the problem is that Inseus is too unpredictable to have a distinct persona.\n\nInseus doesn&apos;t have worshippers as much as he has fans. Morbid and macabre individuals, obssessed with death, blood and mayhem, either recreate his stories, become convinced that they&apos;re touched by him and repeat his actions, or attempt to emulate his own ridiculous escapades. This further muddies the waters for mortal adventurers, who sometimes find that the mad dentist who had been stealing all the teeth of children then fleeing town was in fact Inseus himself, while the mighty warriors of Palescai tracking the black god realise they&apos;ve cornered a late adolescent with heavy delusions and a taste for bloodletting.\nHistory/Relationships:\n\nUnsurprisingly, nobody likes Inseus. Not even the most bloodstained of evil gods can appreciate him - given the small scale in which he works, Vhaulun sees him as too weak as a force of genocide, and given the artless way in which he follows his desires, Sicario regards him as an idiot. While all the evil gods share some stake in Inseus&apos; realm, nobody&apos;s too keen to associate with him. The good gods are just as much annoyed by him - the little madman represents the worst combination of a mortal&apos;s capacity for cruelty and a deity&apos;s persistant nature.\nDogma\n\nI do what I want.

This step to humanity, he felt, would let him ascend to godhood twice over, and therefore, become a mightier force than the other gods combined. He was stopped in this goal by Ravid Godslayer, but as he went to commit a rampage of destruction on the world in his hubris, a simple street mugger stepped out from an alleyway and struck him down with a blackjack.\n\nWith his death, Edih&apos;s divine energy was released, and that mugger attained godhood, claiming the throne deserted by Edih - that of darkness, of pain, of savagery, and of murder. Rather than submit to a greater god, such as Erhymn, she demanded the place on the Pantheon that Edih himself deserted, and was granted it - but along with this power, she was granted the ails and failings of Edih. Without worshippers, the other gods forced the upstart godling to dwell in the Underdeep.\n\nKhei&apos;Szeiya was not cowed or humbled by this treatment, however, and she drew with her a fragment of the elven society of the Crystal City, and a number of dwarven miners who toiled at the mountain Grimspire itself. Whispering to them of power and temptations, she took the seeds of the Drow and Deep Dwarven races. Millennia later, Khei&apos;Szeiya owns to power unheeded, and seems to command a powerful pantheon of the Drow and their connected slave races.\n\nKhei&apos;Szeiya appears as a harsh-featured Drow woman with human ears and a scarred face. When she does appear, however, it is typically in as ostentatious a manner as possible; the subtleties the former thief once lived by have since been destroyed.

  <thing id="dtyMror" name="Mror" description="The world economy of Bidestra is a mostly-representative economy where a gold coin has roughly the same gold content as does seawater. The basis for this economy stems from the Mror holdings, a pledge made in the weeks after Godsday by the dwarven kingdoms to the humans of seven different human nations. These pledges were written out with a promise that they could be exchanged for platinum from the bottomless Mror holds after a period of years has passed. Since that time, the idea of representative currency spread through Bidestra, with every single platinum coin that passes between hands being much more economical than the &apos;real&apos; thing (a platinum coin weighing a fifteenth what a real coin of pure platinum would). This signalled the end of protracted barter and trade, and with that change came the silent, creeping force that was economics - finally and eventually incarnated in the deity Mror, whose first appearance was to many moneylenders and godless mercantile priests on Godsday.\n\nThe avatar of Mror is a single, ten-foot-wide coin that hovers in the air. It does not speak, but the writing around the edge of the coin changes into a readable script. Wherever the coin is, it&apos;s a negotiable currency of some variety - even if only in theory, such as a King&apos;s Perfect Crown (a coin only theoretically minted in Kyngdom and never circulated, worth one hundred million platinum coins). Most temples to Mror - which operate like banks and hospitals at the same time - are decorated with some similar design, some artistic centerpiece that shows an arbitary representation of the most valuable piece of individual currency in a particular country.\n\nThe modern followers of Mror tend to be polite, economical and quite patient. They can assign an account to a deity and know full well that potentially thousands of years to come, it will be paid back, handled by another follower of their deity, and in doing so, the economy of the world is benefitted. They reap profits, then slough those profits back into the economy. Rarely are Mror priests and Mror worshippers wealthy, but they are never uncomfortable when in matters of money. Viewing the world&apos;s economy as a living creature that must be kept healthy, they both save and spend in periods when it helps to ease businesses along.\nHistory/Relationships\n\nMror is one of the most modern of the gods, who came into being and ascended into power in a meteoric rise during the middle of the Second Age, when the Mror Holds Slips were first used as a kind of tradeable currency. Because people began to believe in the slips as having value beyond their actual material value, coinage across Cobrin&apos;Seil slowly underwent a massive change, leading to the economy of the modern world.\n\nMror is therefore a relative newcomer - it was being worshipped with every written banknote, with every clarified business speculation. With the Third Age, Mror did not return to worshippers who had fallen out of its favour, but instead introduced itself to those bankers and priests who had been worshipping it, without realising, for years. To the rest of the gods, Mror is a rather boring entity - as long as the numbers work out in the end, it&apos;s quite happy to take losses ormake sacrifice, and it&apos;s amazingly patient compared to most of the gods. This has, of course, made it right at odds with the Nimble One, who believes the purpose of all forms of currency is to be stolen.\nDogma\n\nA thing is worth exactly what a person will pay for it - no more, no less. Fair trade and good practices serve you in stead over time, and nobody wins in the long term if you cheat.

While other deities own some connection through her, she is the oldest and the first, the original deity whose myth connects to stories of harvest, of renewal, and of beautiful, shimmering dawns. As the first of many such deities, her church is equally old, but dynamic, changing through the generations. Once, she had pyramids built in her name. Then, in time, they built cairns and henges to observe the stars and the sun. In the modern days, she has been seen around observatories, inscribed upon the dome. Ralsan&apos;Lour is a goddess who moves with the times, valuing tradition but embracing change, and she goes where she is most needed; she tends to those who live in the day, the farmers and travellers, but also to those who must brave the night.\n\nRalsan&apos;Lour&apos;s avatar is typically a floating woman, whose legs vanish into a golden, shimmering robe that reflects light in an ever-shifting pattern, surrounded by a nimbus of bright, golden light. She also never has been known to appear between sunset and sunrise, instead opting to send Crescent Guards - or, failing their availability, Moonhounds and Moonlit creatures - to protect sites or work as her intermediary. Just as the moon is the reflection of the sun, so do Ralsan&apos;Lour&apos;s followers carry her light where she herself cannot reach.\n\nRalsan&apos;Lour&apos;s followers within the church tend to be hierarchal and devoted, but she also counts a number of individuals who view the night as theirs to guard. It&apos;s not uncommon to find members of night watches, midnight patrols, search parties or sailors who kiss a small, sun-shaped pendant with a quiet prayer to the Unseen Sister. Those who live in darkness most appreciate the light, and it is to these that Ralsan&apos;Lour lends her strength.\nHistory/Relationships\n\nRalsan&apos;Lour is an old god who has gone by other names in the past, with temples to her worship having been discovered even in the forgotten ruins of Jarrath. The Savalyne of Arnea have even gone so far as to worship her openly, something that flies in the face of their normally insular nature. Her worship has evolved over time, once calling for flowers and moonlit sacrifices of valuables. In time, these sacrifices fell out of favour - Ralsan&apos;Lour discovered a number of sects devoted to her who took her edicts too far, engaging in sacrificing their fellowmen to her in their darkest times. It was due to this practice, it is suggested, that the Crescent Guard were formed, travelling devotees of the sun god that patrol the night for those black acts that lend strength to her enemies.\n\nRalsan&apos;Lour was the deity worshipped - at least in part - by Rheiltan Ducoris when he was a mortal (known as &apos;Lour&apos; at the time), and it is not without anguish that she opposes him now. Lour&apos;s stance on undead is unfortunately tainted by this relationship - she believes that while the possibility of good-aligned and virtuous undead exist, the process of the creation of undead lends strength to Rheiltan, and therefore must be prevented.\n\nRalsan&apos;Lour&apos;s Crescent Guard are often seen working as intermediaries with Schwarzstromites, and with the warriors of Palescai. This relationship is not imagined - due to her neutral stance between the two, Ralsan&apos;Lour is often called upon to play the role of intermediary and peacemaker between the two more volatile, proactive gods.\nDogma\n\nJoy is that most important thing, the light of the sun and life in every one of us. Life is precious, enjoying it moreso; wheresoever you go, carry the light of hope into the darkness. Fear not the undead, for those who walk in darkness cannot touch the faithful. Create not undead, lend no strength to the Fallen Paladin.\n\nHave patience in times of trial, and let adversity be that which draws you together, not divides you. I protect the day and lend strength at night, giving to you, that you might make the night your own. And at dawn and sunset, offer aside a little something of that day and that night to me, as I to you." compset="Deity">

Esteemed by almost exclusively the undead, and holding sway over the ways of death and life, Rheiltahn is at one and the same time the most renowned and despised god that exists.\n\nRheiltahn appears as a tall, imperious vampire, surrounded by a whirling network of spiked chains and dressed in regal finery. Those who have met him and lived have described him as cordial, even sardonic, and only the perpetual stench of death around him indicates he is anything but the paragon of societal virtue. However, he has a furious temper, and flies into extraordinary fits of rage with little to no provocation at times.\n\nRheiltahn&apos;s clerics pray for spells at sunset - when the night and day clash borders, and the day is neither one thing nor another." compset="Deity">

  <thing id="dtySchwarz" name="Schwarzstrom" description="The churning of the clouds, the boom of thunder and the crackle of lightning call out the name of the mighty Mother of Storms, Schwarzstrom. A defender of freedom and passion as well as goodness, the God of Strength demands integrity and virtue from those who would stand at her side. Once a half-elven hero of Cobrin&apos;Seil&apos;s First Age, Schwarzstrom is still rather &quot;mortal&quot; in her attitude; it is her feeling that the standoffish &quot;divine wisdom&quot; and &quot;big picture&quot; views of other deities are poor excuses for not helping their followers. To this end, she spends most of her time roaming the material plane in a mortal body, an inexorable paragon of her own ideals.\n\nSchwarzstrom takes the form of a towering warrior woman with a powerful build, broad shoulders and a proud bearing. Her black hair is wild and unkempt, and her eyes are a dark grey-blue, the colour of deep thunderclouds. She wears sturdy adventuring clothes and myriad battle scars, and wields a preposterously large stone mallet. In artistic works, Schwarzstrom is usually depicted in the midst of a raging storm, representative of her wild nature.\n\nThe Schwarzstrom does not so much hate the concept of Law as think it a distraction from the importance of personal conduct - she seeks not to destroy it, but to prove it unecessary by encouraging each individual to treat others well out of their own goodness, not for fear of repercussion. Her philosophy toward evildoers is one of forgiveness, but not foolishness; redemption should not be denied, but one should never allow the desire for fairness to blind them to true evil.\n\nHer followers are both many and few. Anarchists and idealists the world over add to the Schwarzstrom&apos;s voice by agreeing with her philosophy, though it is most often unknown to them. Those who actively follow her are usually rebels after her own heart, those who are already ill-suited to society&apos;s rules. Schwarzstrom&apos;s clerics (though she has few clerics, in favour of more simple warriors) pray for new spells at varying times of day, each individual choosing the time appropriate for his or her communion.\n\nSchwarzstrom will never grant charm or compulsion spells to any of her followers, and will not accept followers who utilise such effects. A follower may choose to use such effects, but in doing so, must break from her worship. Such an individual may never return to her, even by virtue of an atonement spell. Schwarzstrom does not wish to impose her will on others, so - without resentment - she simply parts ways with those who do not fully embrace her philosophy.\nHistory/Relationships\n\nSchwarzstrom is a staunch opposer of all evil gods, though she has a special place of hatred reserved for the Lord and his impenetrable lies. Vhaulun holds an ages-old grudge against her, but she regards him largely with pity rather than hate. She is regarded as a general nuisance by most of the older good deities, particularly the lawful ones, given her all-too-human penchant for drunken misconduct and unwelcome carousing.\nDogma\n\nChaos is freedom. Do not let the laws of others dictate morality or reason; instead do as you will, without harming the undeserving. Embrace personal responsibility; take no action, make no choice, of which you cannot be proud, and in turn demand accountability from others. In this way will you not destroy law, but render it useless; if every individual is good, law has no purpose, and all can be truly free.\n\nRefuse compromise with evil. There is no acceptable sacrifice, and there is no ends which justifies ill means. Defend those who need you and do not hesitate to destroy what you know is wrong. Yet, do not cause unecessary suffering, even to the truly vile; kill in the name of protection, not in the name of punishment or hatred. Love without fear, and live without regret." compset="Deity">

With no great commitment, Seit and his worshippers are often accused of evil through complacency, but it is greater than that; Seit is dedicated to the cycles, and the ends of things. Seit does not fight that which happens - he merely observes its happening.\n\nSeit appears, and very rarely, as a black-haired, white-skinned human woman in black robes with white eyes and black pupils in which occasional stars twinkle. His clerics frequently take it upon themself to mirror their god&apos;s appearance, and it is this uniform design that helps identify them.\n\nClerics of Seit pray for new spells in the middle of the night. This often leads to odd sleep patterns, and indeed, the interrupted sleep can make such clerics haggard and disgruntled. This is Seit&apos;s way of reminding his clerics that ills visit upon all, and personal health and hygiene deserve attention as much as one can.\n\nClerics of Seit run a gamut of utterly insane, cackling madmen who spread disease and pain for no adequate reason to benevolent, self-sacrificing healers who bestow upon those around them their own health and heartiness. This disparate nature seems to be no concern of Seit&apos;s - he gives spells and powers to all his children." compset="Deity">

  <thing id="dtySicario" name="Sicario" description="Unique amongst the gods of the greater pantheon, Sicario has made a promise to his followers. Exhorting them to emulate his behaviour, he has rendered a pledge in his solitary fortress - that any of his followers who slay him alone will earn his godhead. Of course, equal to that, the person must be considered a follower of his, and a number of powerful heroes have pooled their resources and slain Sicario in the past, only to find that the pledge unmakes them, killing them to restore the deity to life.\n\nAnyone can approach the avatar of Sicario. He sits on a throne in the depths of a fortress in Gehenna, a fortress that is itself, completely empty. Supplied with traps that he never seems to need to replenish and mindless &apos;guards&apos; such as oozes and demonic roaming living spells, Sicario has a perfect defence that must be assaulted alone. In theory, a visitor is free to consult with him and leave, but he just as much reminds people that he is a liar, and a traitor, and has no reason to trust or appreciate another person.\n\nWhile Sicario has a number of followers, he has very no churches and very few actual sites of power. The true individualism he preaches is acommunal and homicidal, teaching his followers to use everyone else, even one another, as he uses them. Subverted, quiet sociopaths that exist in normal societies and use other people for their own joys, the followers of Sicario can seem as subtle as a rude and obnoxious beaurocrat to a genuine serial murderer. It is just a distinction of degrees. He does not tell his followers how to worship him, nor would they listen if they adhered to his beliefs.\nHistory/Relationships:\n\nLike so many evil gods, Sicario is often opposed by Schwarzstrom. While she embraces the idea of a lawless existence, one where every unnecessary stipulation from a legal perspective does nothing to facilitate happiness and good in the world, Sicario&apos;s fundamentally traitorous and selfish perspective flies in the face of the storm god.\nDogma\n\nIn the end, we are all a faction of one. Have no love for anyone who does not benefit yourself. Do as thou wilt as long as no harm comes to yourself - adhere to laws as long as the consequences are worth it, and pay no heed to those laws that do not have any opportunity to bother you. You are special, you are the finest, and anyone else is therefore just meat for your consumption.

While the predominant bent of the Dwarven Pantheon is lawful, the Deep Mountain King himself cares not for law, at least not too much. Moderate in all things, the Deep Mountain King is slow to consider, and slower still to stir to action. Prodigiously old, the Deep Mountain King&apos;s followers speak of a time when all life was as the Deep Mountain King - a sort of pseudo-life, half a living creature, half living stone.\n\nThe Deep Mountain King appears as a fifteen-foot tall giant, brawny in the extremes and composed of equal parts flesh and stone. His enormous hands are always seen gripping a warhammer, and he constantly mines the depths of his undermountain home, seeking out new and interesting forms of gemstone and metal. His hide is constantly studded with gemstones and precious metals, and his beard is as a thick coat of lichen upon a stone.\n\nThe clerics of the Deep Mountain King pray for spells when the earth sighs loudest - which is usually the sixth hour of the evening. His clerics never rebuke undead, deeming such things a hateful aberration against the domain of the Deep Mountain King. While Seit is a god of death, and Rheiltahn a god of the dead, the Deep Mountain King is a god of burials and graves - that any would escape his eternal embrace is an affront. For this reason, he despises undead almost unquestioningly, and that some elven races have given rise to voluntary undead - Baelnorn and Woven Ones - he sees as a personal slight." compset="Deity">

They may see it and they may not - but if it smiling, chances are the joke is on them.\n\nThe Fortuneseeker appears not as a creature but as an object - a single glove, red and black, begemmed and bejewelled on the right hand of gamblers, card sharks, or con men.

The Lord, the Great Deceiver, ascended to the state of Greater Godhood that day, and has since held the position, the False Paladin ever-lying to the world around him. The Lord is worshipped by many common people as a Lawful Neutral deity, never realising the tyrant their god happens to be.

He typically wears silver-enamelled full plate mail, and is rarely without his bastard sword, though it is not unknown for him to appear without it. Given to cordial speech and beautiful wordplay, he can appear for all the world to be an ultimately good man, simply cursed by an inability to adequately communicate, which leads to him being considered abrupt and brash by those who are unwilling to give him a proper chance.\n\nThe Lord&apos;s clerics pray for spells at sunset, when the night is not begun nor the day ended.

Revered by engineers for his reasoned approach, and followed by police for his legal process, The Triune is one of CobrinSeil&apos;s more understated deities.\n\nThe Triune&apos;s avatar is, despite his somewhat archaic and official manner, one of two common forms; either a bronze armour, with a helm that shows three faces on either side of the head, or, and this is more common, a perpetually busy looking man wearing a flanelette shirt, rolled at the sleeves, with a pad bulging in the roll of one sleeve and a pencil tucked behind his ear. Smelling lightly of something industrial, Triune&apos;s avatar goes by a variety of names, such as Mr Trix and Mr San, but generally is always found observing or overseeing something ornate.\n\nMost police officers give credence to Triune. His optimistic perspective on law enforcement - that most people are good, but the laws are there to catch the problems - help to overcome the burden they feel at spending all day dealing with criminals. Judges often read Triune texts, and often Triune churches are the centre of heated discussion after services, as the many legal experts there &apos;talk shop.&apos; Engineers and other craftsmen, people who need to build things to last, people who understand a &apos;margin of safety&apos; often heed to Triune, though it is generally regarded as a failing of an engineer to pray over a design to improve it.\nHistory/Relationships\n\nTo nobody&apos;s great surprise, Triune and Schwarzstrom don&apos;t get along.

The Lord of Ravagers, Vhaulun, while worshipped openly in the lands of trolls and giants, has recently begun to prey on the bigotry of mankind, granting power to those who are xenophobic enough to engage in random acts of hate and slaughter. Vhaulun cares not for racial purity - but the mindless, unthinking destruction of others that it tends to promote pleases him greatly.\n\nVhaulun&apos;s clerics pray for spells at evening, though this stricture of faith is almost an afterthought to the lengthy and hate-filled ranting of the tenets of the Troll-God&apos;s faith.\n\nVhaulun appears, in effigy and avatar, as a black-skinned troll with demonic wings, almost twice the size of a normal troll. His might is prodigious, and second only to Schwarzstrom amongst the gods (though El, the Hidden One, can lay claims to greater might than Vhaulun). The might of Vhaulun manifests itself in outbursts of fury and rage, insanely destroying all around him. He is known at times as the Lone God, for his court know best to avoid close contact with him." compset="Deity">

It is a well-known fact that demons, devils, and their various permutations are so intimately bound with the nature of evil that it pervades their very being. These creatures, however, are not ultimately forbidden from changing - it is merely that the idea of a life that is different is often so very strange to them that it can send them mad. However, there are those, occasional creatures who rebel against their parentage and heritage, and to them, the secret of such things is revealed - that to the soul, a Solar is but a Pit Fiend of a differing predilection.\n\nYojandur the Accepting was not a god at first. He was a Devil Lord, the Pit Fiend Kohlund. However, history has proven that the ranker the heart, the greater the redemption. An unknowable event prompted a single, solitary spark of neutrality in the mighty beast, and so, he was redeemed by steps, until finally, he stood in the Pantheon, ready to assume the mantle of redemption, opening the gates to all outcasts and lost. He appears, despite his transition, as a Pit Fiend with glowing yellow eyes and beautiful white wings.\n\nYojandur&apos;s clerics pray for new spells every morning, before the sun rises, that they may glory in the appearance of a new dawn with the memory of communion fresh in their mind - that no matter what the day holds, there is a moment of peace and joy at the beginning." compset="Deity">

  <thing id="bgRaguzOrd" name="Raguzan Order" description="{b}{i}COME HAVE A GO IF YOU THINK YOU’RE HARD ENOUGH{/i}{/b}\n\nRaguzans are the cunning, brawly, slightly drunken sibling of the other orders. They are most often found guarding highways by travelling with strangers, retaliating to threats or incursions on towns, or presenting force and strength in church locations where infrastructure is modest. They’re commonly involved in protecting pilgrims or in questing duties, when not called upon as a military force.\n\nThe Raguzan relationship with other orders is pretty simple; they’re louts. They’re wild and rarely disciplined, without much record keeping or reports, and they prefer to handle violations of knightly code in-house. Since the Raguzan justice system is largely focused on good outcomes and not protocol, this means some sketchy behaviour gets cleared, and it irritates the other orders a great deal. Nonetheless, while Raguzans can often only be relied upon to attack things, they do it very well. \n\nRaguzans have the most working class individuals, people who became knights from battlefield promotions or honouring for some special deeds and have the least access to money and resources. Notably, the Raguzans do have access to Royal Kennel rights, meaning that their chapterhouses often have stables, kennels, mews, and other facilities. Raguzans have some of the best animal trainers in the Protectorate, with specialised tools like dire war ferrets and messenger rats.\n\nRaguzans are also renowned for being siegebreakers, and it’s there that a strange second side of sophisticated genius comes to bear. Raguzans don’t just throw themselves at sieges, as they have a trained corps of disciplined but practical engineers skilled in disarming and disabling traps and explosives, dismantling barricades, routing water and other liquids and all sorts of other useful skills for forcing an end to a siege.\n\nAt Their Best: Raguzan are knights of the commoners, people who stand up to and break systems that crush the weak underfoot.\nAt Their Worst: Raguzan fight for the sake of fighting and cause more problems than they solve.\n\n{b}Benefit:{/b} Your starting hit points are increased by 5." compset="Background">

  <thing id="fthRagWay1" name="Raguzan Wayfinder Starting Feature" description="Raguzan Wayfinders use animal companions. These are usually animals trained from Raguzan stock, with a number of small companions for specialised tasks and one larger companion for generalised tasks.\n\n Choose one of the following creatures:\n* Journeyhound, strong hardworking war dogs.\n* Grifkin, smaller, more agile griffons for combat scenarios.\n* Carcaj, a type of wolverine bred for travel.\n* Guardbadger, sturdy and stubborn badgers that heed a companion.\n\nYou gain it as your Wayfinder Beast Companion. If you wish, you can select a Beast Companion from the Wayfinder Beast Companion list.\n\nThemes and Flavour: If you find you would rather a type of beast not included in this list, it is definitely worth considering re-flavouring the existing beasts as options. For example:\n* Journeyhounds can be used to represnt wolves, dingoes, or dholes\n* Grifkin can be used to represent large bats or immense hunting birds\n* Carcaj can be used to represent animals like Tasmanian Devils or Dire Weasels\n* Guardbadgers can be used to represent heavy animals like monitor lizards or small bears\n\nYour Wayfinder Beast Companion is considered an ally of you and your allies. It can be affected by powers in the same way that any other creature can be. It has animal intelligence, so you can communicate with it only at a basic level (like a trained pet), and it doesn&apos;t understand complex ideas.\n\nYour Wayfinder Beast Companion&apos;s level is equal to yours, and its hit points, defenses, and attack values are determined by your level, as noted in its statistics.\n\nYour companion shares your healing surge total. Whenever an effect requires your Wayfinder Beast Companion to spend a healing surge, the surge is deducted from your total. Whenever you use your second wind, your companion also regains hit points equal to your healing surge value. At the end of a short rest, your Wayfinder Beast Companion regains all its hit points.\n\nIf you die or your companion drops below 1 hit point, it retreats from the battlefield and preserves itself safely. If that occurs, you can use one of these two ways to call it back.\n\n* {b}Minor Action:{/b} You lose a healing surge, and your companion appears in the nearest unoccupied space, with hit points equal to your healing surge value; your companion derives strength from your resolve, and recovers, coming back to the battlefield to fight alongside you.\n* {b}Short Rest or Extended Rest:{/b} At the end of the rest, you lose a healing surge, and your companion appears in the nearest unoccupied space, with full hit points.\n\n{b}Journeyhound Companion{/b}\nRaguzans have almost as many types of hound available as they have chapterhouses, but the defining traits of a Raguzan Journeyhound are pretty consistent. They are hardworking, tough dogs, somewhere in size near a wolf, intelligent enough to take a variety of commands and take to a variety of purposes, like hunting, covering, sheltering, seeking, fetching and fighting. \n\n{b}Grifkin Companion{/b}\nOnce an endangered species, the Grifkin are small relatives of the griffon; while a griffon has a prominent, entirely birdlike head, the Grifkin look more like large housecats, with feathered wings and antlers, and prominent birdlike hindclaws. Primarily trained by the Raguzan for anti-cavalry purposes, Grifkin are extremely mobile, often hunting around battlefields to attack enemies that present opportunities.\n\n{b}Carcaj Companion{/b}\nRaguzans that travel often need companions that are capable of independent survival. A type of wolverine, Carcajs are hard to train to most of the needs of a knight, but when bound to a Wayfinder with love, understanding, and stubbornness, they thrive. Carcajs fight fiercely for their companion and can subsist on almost anything, making them excellent companions for Wayfinders in cold climates. \n\n{b}Guardbadger Companion{/b}\nRaguzans don’t always exist in harsh environments. Many Wayfinders travel along well-peopled highways and need a companion that is capable of navigating a city somewhat competently and protecting people while waiting for the knight to reach them. Guardbadgers, larger and more solid relatives of the badger, serve this purpose admirably, often blocking enemies with their bodies, and keeping a single foe from making meaningful progress." compset="ThemeFeat">

  <thing id="bgChardOrd" name="Chardunite Order" description="{b}Secret Sins Need Secret Saviors{/b}\n\nThe Chardunists are known as the secret fourth order. Originally the Church’s arm of Inquisition created to eradicate sources of Psionic power (known once as the Shandrelle Heresy), their power grew and, and so to their ability to hide from oversight until eventually, they re-emerged (then just as quickly hid themselves again) as a Knightly Order protecting psionic entities from oppression, which they refer to as The Task. Chardunists are sometimes referred to as ‘The secret police’ of the nation, which isn’t correct. They see their roles as creating safe spaces for psionic individuals to exist safely away from church oppression, and acting in the name of the Crown to oppose problems that can’t be dealt with by throwing military force at it. \n\nChardunists keep their actions extremely covert, and even going so far as to use psionic powers to make people forget the locations of their chapterhouses and meeting halls. Chardunist writing includes ethical application of psionic powers, and come down extremely hard on those they see as violating these rules. This means that they seem inscrutable to other orders - Pandions don’t trust them for their secrecy, Lethenites don’t see why they can’t be trusted with the threats they contain, and Raguzans have strong views against mind influencing magic in the first place. Chardunists often regard the other orders as painfully unaware of the kinds of problems they deal with.\n\nChardunists are however, the least obviously knightly of the orders - most Chardunists need to be able to blend into normal societies, and therefore tend to favour roles and identities that seem extremely vague or unimportant. Coopers and wagon drivers, couriers and minor officials, Chardunists are also the most likely to be an inhuman or unnatural race thanks to the order’s stance of recruitment for the Task.\n\nAt Their Best: Chardunists are the salvation of the invisible, the saviors of people who think they have nobody to turn to, never needing to be asked or thanked.\nAt Their Worst: Chardunists are secretive and untrustworthy agents whose inability to communicate leads to worse outcomes for others that they can’t ever explain.\n\n{b}Benefit:{/b}:\n* Training in Arcana, Streetwise, or Stealth\n* +2 skill bonus to Arcana, Streetwise, or Stealth" compset="Background" uniqueness="unique">

This started the Chardunists on a path that eventually led to their rejection of church dogma about psionics, and adoption into their own ranks those who they once hunted. The Chardunist Mindhunters are Chardunists with psionic talent that specialise in dealing with either the recover of psionic individuals or dealing with hostile psionic monsters.\n\n{b}Building A Chardunist Mindhunter{/b}\nIf you’re building a character who wants power points, the Mindhunter has an extra point, which is very desirable. If you want to play a non-psionic character who gets a few psionic abilities, though, the Mindhunter is a great way to expand your options. Regardless, the Chardunist Mindhunter cares about enemies being near to them, and about opportunity attacks (as both attacker and defender)." compset="Theme" uniqueness="unique">
